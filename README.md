# Vagrant-Skipfish

This repository will create a Ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine with the **[Skipfish](http://code.google.com/p/skipfish/)** web application security scanner installed.

> **Skipfish** is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a
recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then
annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully
non-disruptive) security checks. The final report generated by the tool is
meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security
assessments.

_The version of Skipfish installed will be **2.10b**_

### Requirements

1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)

### Getting Started

In order to provision a new virtual machine, run `vagrant up` from a terminal in this project's root directory. Once the provisioning is complete you can SSH into the new virtual machine using `vagrant ssh`. You will find a symlink to the skipfish installation in your home directory.

If you need to update the vagrant box to the latest version, run `vagrant box update`.

Once your done, you can shutdown the virtual machine using `vagrant down`. You can also completely delete the machine using `vagrant destroy`.
